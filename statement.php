			<p>Working with pencils and paint, and directly from a subject, I am always looking to create an interpretation, rather then a replica. To make a painting look spontaneous is difficult. Striping out the detail, but retaining the raw essence of a subject is my ultimate goal.</p>
			<p>A background working in wildlife film making at the BBC's Natural History Unit has informed and influenced my passion for telling stories on canvas.</p>
			<p>Lord Bath is a patron of my work, and my portrait The Bird Man was short-listed for the 2009 BP National Portrait Award.</p>
			<p>Exhibitions are planned throughout 2012, and I will be illustrating the upcoming book <i>Dandelion Lawn - a year in the wild garden</i>, which tells the story of converting our little plot in the heart of Somerset into something really special for wildlife. It is due out in Autumn 2012.<br/>

She uses oil paints which have great depth and versatility. The palette, subject and forms come together to make a very striking but unfussy piece of art that is beguiling.</i><span class="pullQuote close">&rdquo;</span></p>
