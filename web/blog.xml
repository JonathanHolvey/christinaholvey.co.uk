		<title>Grey skies and goldfinches</title>

		<content>&lt;p&gt;From my studio I can see goldfinches perched amongst apple blossom, and a crowd of British bluebells bowing their heads at the edge of the meadow. Our chickens peck at stale hot cross buns in the dappled sunlight under a giant beech, whose buds are just bursting.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the vegetable bed, rocket seedlings twinkle like green stars in a black sky of horse manure, and the lawn is a deli counter of worms for both families of robin and blackbird, who are nest-neighbours down by the stream.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Acid yellow primroses and egg yolk daffodils are gently replaced by the violet hues of granny bonnets, wisteria, and of course the tinkling blue strings of bells. As the season gathers pace it celebrates one primary colour then another. A grey based palette is a beautiful thing, but I love colour too much to allow it much space in either my garden or paintings. The only angry shade of grey out there is the sky, as it unleashes a sudden downpour.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The goldfinches vanish and the chickens hide under a tin roof, but it is only an April shower; in two minutes the birds are back and the plants glisten gloriously, as if varnished by raindrops.&lt;/p&gt;</content>
